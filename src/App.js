      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>At Zappos.com, our purpose is Simple : to live and deliver WOW.</p>
      <p>Twenty years ago we began as a small retailer that only sold shoes. Today we still sell shoes - as well as <br></br> clothing, handbags, accessories and more. The "more" is providing the best customer service, customer experience and <br/>company culture. We are showing the world that it is possible to simultaneously deliver<br/> happiness to  the customers, employees, vendors and community in long term sustainable way.</p>
      <p>We hope that in the future people wont even realize that we started selling shoes online. Instead they will know Zappos as a <br/>service company that  sells ____</p>
